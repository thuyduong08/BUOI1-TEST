    <p class="child1"> Tet Holiday - an occasion to enjoy life after a full hard-working year. So how do we celebrate
        Tet Holiday in
        Vietnam? Follow us in this blog!</p>
</div>
<div class="parent">
    <p class="child"> Tet Holiday - Tet Nguyen Dan, more commonly known by its shortened name Tet. It is the most
        important and popular
        holiday and festival in Vietnam. It is the Vietnamese New Year marking the arrival of spring based on the Lunar
        calendar. The name Tet Nguyen Dan is Sino-Vietnamese for Feast of the First Morning. Tet Holiday is coming so
        let's take a look at some traditions and customs of this special holiday in Vietnam.</p>

</div>
<div class="parent3">
    <p class="child3">The dates of the Lunar New Year differ every year but it generally takes place around late January
        or February.
        This year, under the plan from the government, officials, civil servants, and workers of public agencies will
        begin their 2023 Tet holiday from January 20 (the 29th day of the 12th lunar month) to January 26 (the fifth day
        of the first lunar month). In this time period, companies (including ABROADER) in the country will not be
        working to celebrate the great holiday of the year.</p>

<div class="parent5">
    <p class="child5"> While Tet shares many similarities with the Chinese New Year such as the Lunar Calendar system,
        there is more to
        differentiate. For instance, the zodiac animal of 2023 is Cat while in other countries, the spiritual animal is
        Lyn. Vietnamese people consider Tet Holiday the best occasion for family members to return home and get
        together. During Tet, Vietnamese spend time shopping for the New Year and going to Pagodas and Temples. The
        items of shopping range from food to clothing to decorations for the house. The Vietnamese believe that Tet
        Holiday is an occasion to enjoy life after a full hard-working year. Thus people forget their struggles and
        focus on making the celebration as festive as possible. With high regard, Tet is unique, with distinctive colors
        and flavors of truly celebrating the new year.

<div class="parent7">
    <h2 class="child7">Banh chung (Sticky square cake)</h2>
</div>
<div class="parent8">
    <p class="child8">Banh Chung is a food that they make from glutinous rice, mung bean, and pork, added with many
        other ingredients.
        It is covered by green leaves and symbolizes the Earth, invented by prince Lang Lieu from the Hung King dynasty.
        Banh Chung is the main food for the Tet holiday because it can last for long days in Vietnamese weather. And
        families usually store Banh Chung at room temperature for nearly 1 month.</p>
</div>
<div class="parent9">
    <h2 class="child9">Gio, cha (Vietnamese sausage)</h2>
</div>
<div class="parent10">
    <p class="child10">Vietnamese ham/sausage ‚Äì Gio/Cha is another traditional food on T·∫øt holiday. We usually serve it
        with Xoi (sticky
        rice) and Banh Chung. Gio is different from Cha since Gio is boiled and Cha is deep-fried. Cha is also made of
        lean pork and ingredients. However, they do not wrap Cha in leaves and boiled but deep-fried in oil.</p>
</div>
<div class="parent11">
    <h2 class="child11">Thit kho hot vit (Braised Pork Belly with Duck Egg)</h2>
</div>
<div class="parent12">
    <p class="child12">This dish is more popular in the South than in the North. However, no one can deny the
        irresistible aroma,
        flavor, and great compatibility of this dish. People cook Pork Belly and Egg with coconut juice and fish sauce.
        When it is cooked, it becomes tender and absorbs all those unique flavors. The dish is so universal and easy to
        make. Therefore, it has become one of the most popular dishes served during the Tet Holiday.</p>
</div>
<div class="parent13">
    <h2 class="child13">Xoi (Sticky rice)</h2>
</div>
<div class="parent14">
    <p class="child14">Xoi is also a very important part of the Tet holiday in Vietnam. Along with Banh Chung, Xoi is
        the main staple
        food for the T·∫øt holiday. It has many forms: Xoi Lac (sticky rice with peanuts), Xoi ƒêo Xanh (sticky rice with
        mung bean), Xoi Gac (sticky rice with special ‚Äúgac‚Äù fruit). Among these types, x√¥i g·∫•c is the favorite the most
        people because of its special red color ‚Äì which symbolizes luck and new achievement for the New Year.</p>
</div>
<div class="parent15">
    <h2 class="child15">Mut (Sugar-coated fruit)</h2>
</div>
<div class="parent16">
    <p class="child16">Mut Tet (Tet Sugar-coated fruit) is not a food to serve in a meal during the Tet holiday. It‚Äôs
        more like a snack
        to welcome guests in this special period. This once-in-year mix of snacks is very large in variety, with so many
        tastes: ginger, carrot, coconut, pineapple, pumpkin, lotus seed, star fruit, etc.
        And there is also a lot more unique food in Vietnam, awaiting you to try.</p>
</div>
<div class="parent17">
    <h2 class="child17">Traditional customs</h2>
</div>
<div class="parent18">
    <p class="child18">Even though many Vietnamese traditions are based on old cultural beliefs that may strike some as
        a little
        superstitious, families believe that their activities during Tet must involve happiness, joy, and good luck.
        Below are some of the popular, long-standing Tet traditional customs that have stood the test of time from
        generation to generation.</p>

<div class="parent19">
    <h2 class="child19">Giving Li xi (lucky money)</h2>
</div>
<div class="parent20">
    <p class="child20">The first day of the Tet holiday is for the nuclear family. Children receive a red envelope
        containing money from
        their elders. This tradition is called ‚Äúmung tuoi‚Äù (happy new age) in the north and l√¨ x√¨ in the south. Usually,
        children wear their new clothes and give their elders the traditional T·∫øt greetings before receiving the money.

        And we want to wish you good luck, happiness, and a meaningful and adventurous new year with our red envelopes
        of:</p>

<div class="parent21">
    <h2 class="child21">X√¥ng nh√†</h2>
</div>
<div class="parent22">
    <p class="child22">Since the Vietnamese believe that the first visitor a family receives in the year determines
        their fortune for
        the entire year, people never enter any house on the first day without being invited first. People call the act
        of being the first person to enter the home on Tet Holiday ‚Äúxong dat, xong nha or dap dat‚Äù, which is one of the
        most important rituals during T·∫øt. According to Vietnamese tradition, if good things come to the family on the
        first day of the lunar New Year, the following year will also be full of blessings. Usually, a person of good
        temper, morality, and success will be a lucky sign for the host family.
        During subsequent days, people visit relatives and friends. Traditionally but not strictly, the second and even
        painting their home in anticipation of spring, settle old debts and disputes, and pledge to behave nicely and
        work hard in the new year.</p>
</div>
<div class="parent23">
    <h2 class="child23">Decorations</h2>
</div>
<div class="parent24">
    <p class="child24">Traditionally, each family displays ‚ÄúCay neu‚Äù, an artificial New Year Tree consisting of a bamboo
        pole 5 to 6 m
        long. The top end is usually decorated with many objects, depending on the locality, including good luck charms,
        origami fish, cactus branches, etc.
        At Tet, we decorate every house with ‚Äúhoa mai‚Äù ‚Äì Ochna integerrima (in the central and southern parts of
        Vietnam) or ‚Äúhoa ƒëao‚Äù ‚Äì cherry blossom (in the northern part of Vietnam) or ‚Äúhoa ban‚Äù (in mountain areas). In
        the north or central, the kumquat tree is a popular decoration for the living room during Tet. Its bright
        orange-colored fruits represent the fertility and fruitfulness that the family hopes for in the coming year. And
        how to decorate the house, you can reference this article.</p>
